# GitHub-Trello-Poster (Retired)
**This repo has been archived as we no longer use Trello.**

This app uses GitHub webhooks to be notified when a Pull Request is opened or changed on GitHub.  When it finds a link to a Trello card in the Pull Request, it posts a link to that Pull Request to a checklist on the card it finds.  When a Pull Request is merged or closed, the app checks the Pull Request off the checklist, even in cases where a user may have modified the item in the checklist.

## User Stories

## Technical Documentation
This app is built using Ruby and Sinatra.  It makes use of GitHub webhooks to receive pull request information, and the Trello API to post pull request information to Trello cards.

### Setting up the app
1. Run `bundle install`.
1. Create a Trello account and add it to your team's Trello board, giving read and write access. On GOV.UK, we use the [@pullrequestposter](https://trello.com/u/pullrequestposter) user.
1. Get your [Trello developer API key](https://trello.com/app-key) and assign to the `TRELLO_PUBLIC_KEY` environment variable. You may also find this key using [ruby-trello's](https://github.com/jeremytregunna/ruby-trello) helpful methods.
1. Get your [Trello user token](https://developers.trello.com/authorize) and assign to the `TRELLO_MEMBER_TOKEN` environment variable. You may also find this token using [ruby-trello's](https://github.com/jeremytregunna/ruby-trello) helpful methods.
1. Deploy github-trello-poster to your preferred platform, or run locally with `ruby app.rb` and use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to open a secure tunnel to your localhost.
1. Set up the webhook between your repo(s) and github-trello-poster. This is [done automatically by govuk-saas-config](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-saas-config/blob/ac02bd03637f41e7274c739bcb650fcabca1121e/github/lib/configure_repo.rb#L57-L77) for all GOV.UK repos. To set it up manually, go into your repo settings in GitHub and create a webhook pointing to your payload URL ('https://[insert-your-site-here]/payload'), select a content type of `application/json`, then finally choose 'Let me select individual events' and check the 'Pull requests' box.

### Running the test suite
Run `bundle exec rspec`.
Note the feature tests require real-world set up of Trello cards and GitHub repos, and you will need to amend the tests accordingly.
